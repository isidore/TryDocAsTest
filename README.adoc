= Starting project

This project is a simple starting point to experiment testing using a living documentation.

== Prerequisite

You need to get .jar.

The simplest way is to download `.jar` and `.pom` from last package at `https://github.com/sfauvel/documentationtesting`.

Run the maven command to install it locally:

----
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file>.jar -DpomFile=<path-to-pomfile>.pom
----

Then, you can edit `pom.xml` to edit `documentationtesting.version` properties if it's necessary.

== Quick start

Execute tests using `mvn test` or with yout IDE.

Each test is associated to a file in `src/test/docs` with a name that ends in `approved`.
If test output is different from `approved` file, a `received` file is created and test fails.

To create an asciidoc file that aggregate all test files generated, execute `DocGenerator.main`.
This file is converted to html and put in `docs` folder.
